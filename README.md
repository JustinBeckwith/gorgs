# Usage

Gorgs will scan for all GitHub issues within an organization, and cache them in memory.  The list gets updated every 5 minutes.  You can get the list back by hitting the `/issues` endpoint.  That's it!

```
git clone git@github.com:JustinBeckwith/gorgs.git
cd gorgs
export GH_TOKEN=your_github_token
export GH_ORG=your_github_org
npm start
```
